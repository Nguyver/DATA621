##Critical Thinking Group 4 - HW1

Let me know what you guys think. We can use this file to do the coding and document details for each other. At the end, when we are done, we put together a much cleaner document without all the details and code we left for each other.  

Read in the file to do Exploratory Data Analysis
```{r}
#read directly from the github
moneyballTraining <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nguyver/DATA621-HW/master/HW1/moneyball-training-data.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

head(moneyballTraining)
summary(moneyballTraining)

#Cleaning ?


#Data Exploration:

# 'TARGET_WINS' is the Dependent/Response variable here. And below are the independent (/exploratory) variables.
# Indpendent Variables: TEAM_BATTING_H TEAM_BATTING_2B TEAM_BATTING_3B  TEAM_BATTING_HR  TEAM_BATTING_BB TEAM_BATTING_SO  TEAM_BASERUN_SB TEAM_BASERUN_CS

# Let us try to explore each of the exploratory variable's distribution [histogram, boxplot - to understand the distribution and identify outliers etc.]
# Let us also explore how each of the independent variable related to the response variable ( using scatter plot )
# what else ?

#
library(ggplot2)

# Explore independent variable TEAM_BATTING_H
ggplot(data = moneyballTraining) + geom_histogram(aes(x=TEAM_BATTING_H), binwidth = 0.5) + ggtitle(paste("Histogram  - " , "TEAM_BATTING_H")) 

qplot(y=moneyballTraining$TEAM_BATTING_H, x= 1, geom = "boxplot")

ggplot(data = moneyballTraining) + geom_point(aes(x=TEAM_BATTING_H, y= TARGET_WINS), alpha = 0.2, color="blue") + ggtitle("TARGET WINS  Vs TEAM_BATTING_H")
